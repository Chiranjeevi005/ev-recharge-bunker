# Dashboard Fix Summary

This document summarizes the steps taken to fix the dashboard data fetching issues.

## Problem Identified

The dashboard was not displaying correctly due to Redis not being installed/running. The application requires Redis for real-time features including:
- Charging session tracking
- Payment status updates
- Slot availability caching
- UI updates

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Redis Configuration
Updated `.env.local` file to include Redis URL:
```
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

### 2. Installed Redis Server
Downloaded and installed Windows-compatible Redis server from:
https://github.com/tporadowski/redis/releases/download/v5.0.14.1/Redis-x64-5.0.14.1.zip

### 3. Started Redis Server
Launched Redis server on port 6379:
```
cd redis-windows
./redis-server.exe
```

### 4. Restarted Development Server
Restarted the Next.js development server to pick up the Redis connection:
```
npm run dev
```

## Verification

### Redis Status
- ✅ Redis server running on port 6379
- ✅ Accepting connections
- ✅ Ready to handle real-time data

### Development Server Status
- ✅ Next.js server running on port 3002
- ✅ Application accessible at http://localhost:3002
- ✅ Environment variables loaded correctly

## Expected Results

With Redis now running:
1. Dashboard should load without data fetching errors
2. Real-time updates should work for:
   - Charging session status
   - Payment updates
   - Slot availability
3. All dashboard components should display correctly:
   - Environmental Impact stats
   - Eco Journey Highlights
   - Slot Availability with icons
   - Payment History with badges

## Next Steps

1. Access the dashboard at http://localhost:3002/dashboard
2. Verify all components are loading correctly
3. Test real-time updates by simulating charging sessions or payments
4. Monitor console logs for any remaining issues

## Files Modified

1. `.env.local` - Added Redis URL configuration
2. Created `redis-windows` directory with Redis binaries
3. Started Redis server process (running in background)

## Commands to Restart Services

If services need to be restarted:

1. Start Redis server:
   ```
   cd redis-windows
   ./redis-server.exe
   ```

2. Start development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

The dashboard should now work correctly with real-time data updates.
