# Payment Flow Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Environment Variable Mismatch
**Problem**: The frontend was using `NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` but the environment variable was named `NEXT_PUBLIC_RZP_KEY_ID`.

**Fix**: Updated all frontend components to use the correct environment variable name:
- `src/app/find-bunks/page.tsx`
- `src/components/dashboard/BookingPanel.tsx`
- `src/app/test-payment/page.tsx`

### 2. Payment Verification API Improvements
**Problem**: Limited logging made it difficult to debug payment verification issues.

**Fix**: Enhanced `src/app/api/payment/verify/route.ts` with:
- Additional logging for request body and parameters
- Detailed signature verification logging
- Better error handling and response messages
- Enhanced debugging information for payment record searches

### 3. Navbar Component Restoration
**Problem**: The Navbar component was modified incorrectly, adding a test payment link that broke core functionality.

**Fix**: Restored `src/components/landing/Navbar.tsx` to its original state without the test payment link.
