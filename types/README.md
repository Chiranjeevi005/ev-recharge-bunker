# Type Declarations

This directory contains TypeScript declaration files for modules that don't have built-in type definitions.

## CSS Modules

The [css.d.ts](file:///c:/Users/Chiranjeevi%20PK/Desktop/ev-bunker/types/css.d.ts) file provides type definitions for CSS imports, allowing TypeScript to understand and validate CSS module imports throughout the application.
