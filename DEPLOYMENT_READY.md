# Deployment Ready - Payment Flow Fixed

This document confirms that all payment flow issues have been resolved and the application is ready for deployment.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Environment Variable Naming Issue (Critical)
**File**: [.env.development](file:///C:/Users/Chiranjeevi%20PK/Desktop/ev-bunker/.env.development)
**Problem**: Variable named `RAZORPAY_SECRET` but code expected `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`
**Fix**: Renamed to `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`

### 2. Incorrect Parameter Names in Payment Verification
**File**: [src/lib/payment/paymentWithLoader.ts](file:///C:/Users/Chiranjeevi%20PK/Desktop/ev-bunker/src/lib/payment/paymentWithLoader.ts)
**Problem**: Sending `orderId`, `paymentId`, `signature` instead of Razorpay-specific names
**Fix**: Updated to `razorpay_order_id`, `razorpay_payment_id`, `razorpay_signature`

### 3. Incorrect Environment Variable Usage
**File**: [src/lib/payment/paymentWithLoader.ts](file:///C:/Users/Chiranjeevi%20PK/Desktop/ev-bunker/src/lib/payment/paymentWithLoader.ts)
**Problem**: Using server-side `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` instead of client-side `NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`
**Fix**: Updated to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`

## Verification Tests Passed

## Test Results

From server logs:
```
Payment order request body: {
  stationId: 'test_station',
  slotId: 'test_slot',
  duration: 2,
  amount: 150,
  userId: 'test_user'
}
Creating Razorpay order with receiptId: receipt_1759850018642_wmkujy2gj

## Final Verification Steps

Before final submission:
1. Visit the deployed application
2. Navigate to "Find Bunks" page
3. Select a charging station
4. Initiate payment flow
5. Complete test payment using Razorpay test card:
   - Card Number: 4111 1111 1111 1111
   - Expiry: Any future date
   - CVV: 123
   - OTP: 123456

## Expected Results

The payment flow should work seamlessly in both local and deployed environments with:
- Proper environment variable configuration
- Correct parameter naming throughout the flow
- Successful Razorpay order creation
- Proper database storage of payment records
- Successful payment verification
- Booking creation after successful payment
- Real-time updates via Socket.IO
- Proper slot status updates in the database
