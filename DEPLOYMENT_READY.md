## Vercel Deployment Instructions

### Quick Deploy Steps:
1. Commit and push your code to a Git repository
2. Connect your repository to Vercel
3. Set the required environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy!

### Required Environment Variables:
```
DATABASE_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_generated_secret_key
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-app.vercel.app
REDIS_URL=your_redis_connection_string (optional)
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=your_razorpay_secret
NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=your_razorpay_key_id
ARCJET_KEY=your_arcjet_key
```

### Generate NEXTAUTH_SECRET:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

## Payment Integration Requirements

For payment processing to work correctly, you must:

1. **Set up a Razorpay account**:
   - Sign up at https://razorpay.com
   - Get your API keys from the dashboard

2. **Configure environment variables**:
   - `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` - Your Razorpay key ID
   - `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET` - Your Razorpay secret key
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` - Same as RAZORPAY_KEY_ID (for frontend)

3. **For testing**:
   - Use Razorpay's test keys during development
   - Use test card details:
     - Card Number: 4111 1111 1111 1111
     - Expiry: Any future date
     - CVV: 123
     - OTP: 123456
