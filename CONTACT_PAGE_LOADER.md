# Contact Page Loader Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the universal loader for the contact page to ensure consistent animation flow with other pages in the application.

## Problem
The contact page was not using the universal loader system, which created an inconsistent user experience compared to other pages in the application. Users navigating to the contact page would not see the same smooth loading animations.

## Solution
Implemented the universal loader system for the contact page by:
1. Adding the `useRouteTransition` hook to handle page transitions
2. Ensuring the Navbar navigation uses the universal loader
3. Maintaining consistent loader behavior with other pages

## Implementation Details

### 1. Contact Page Component (`src/app/contact/page.tsx`)

#### Added Dependencies
```typescript
import { useRouteTransition } from '@/hooks/useRouteTransition'; // Added import
```

#### Hook Integration
```typescript
const ContactPage = () => {
  
  const { showLoader, hideLoader } = useLoader(); // Added loader context
  const mapContainerRef = useRef<HTMLDivElement>(null);
  const mapRef = useRef<maplibregl.Map | null>(null);
  
  // Initialize route transition handler
  useRouteTransition();
  
  // ... rest of component
}
```

### 2. Navbar Integration (`src/components/landing/Navbar.tsx`)

The Navbar was already configured to use the universal loader for contact page navigation:

```typescript
<button 
  onClick={() => handleNavigation("/contact", "Loading contact page...")}
  className="text-[#CBD5E1] hover:text-white transition-all duration-300 text-sm lg:text-base nav-item-hover"
>
  Contact
</button>
```

### 3. Existing Form Submission Loader

The contact form was already using the loader for form submissions:

```typescript
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  setIsSubmitting(true);
  setSubmitStatus(null);
  showLoader("Sending your message..."); // Show loader
  
  try {
    // ... form submission logic ...
    
    if (response.ok) {
      // ... success handling ...
      hideLoader(); // Hide loader
    } else {
      // ... error handling ...
      throw new Error(errorData.error || 'Failed to send message');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Submission error:', error);
    setSubmitStatus('error');
    hideLoader(); // Hide loader
  } finally {
    setIsSubmitting(false);
  }
};
```

## Key Features

### 1. Consistent Navigation Experience
- Contact page now uses the same loader system as other pages
- Smooth transitions between all navigation points
- Unified loading experience across the application

### 2. Route Transition Handling
- `useRouteTransition` hook manages page load states
- Automatic loader display during route changes
- Proper cleanup and timing management

### 3. Form Submission Integration
- Existing form submission loader functionality preserved
- Combined page navigation and form submission loaders
- Consistent user feedback during all interactions

## Benefits

1. **Unified User Experience**: Contact page now matches the loading behavior of other pages
2. **Smooth Transitions**: No more abrupt page loads without animation
3. **Professional Appearance**: Consistent loading animations throughout the application
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All existing form submission features preserved
5. **Future-Proof**: Easy to extend with additional loader states if needed

## Technical Details

### Component Integration
- Added `useRouteTransition` hook to contact page component
- Leveraged existing `useLoader` context for manual loader control
- Utilized existing Navbar navigation system

### State Management
- Page loading state managed by route transition handler
- Form submission state managed separately
- No conflicts between different loader states

### Performance
- Minimal impact on page load performance
- Efficient hook usage
- Proper cleanup of resources

## Testing

The implementation has been verified to ensure:
1. Contact page navigation shows universal loader
2. Form submissions continue to show loader
3. No conflicts between navigation and form loaders
4. Consistent timing with other pages
5. Proper cleanup of loader states

## Files Modified
1. `src/app/contact/page.tsx` - Added route transition hook integration

## Future Considerations
- Could add more granular loader states for map initialization
- May implement progress indicators for long-running operations
- Could enhance with skeleton screens for better perceived performance
