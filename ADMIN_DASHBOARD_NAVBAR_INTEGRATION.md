# Admin Dashboard Navbar Integration

## Overview
The redesigned admin dashboard has been successfully integrated with the Navbar navigation system. Authenticated users can now access the admin dashboard through the "Dashboard" link in both desktop and mobile navigation.

## Current Implementation

### Desktop Navigation
- The "Dashboard" link is visible in the top right corner for authenticated users
- Admin users are directed to `/dashboard/admin`
- Regular users are directed to `/dashboard`
- The link has a distinctive purple color (`text-[#8B5CF6]`) to stand out

### Mobile Navigation
- The "Dashboard" link appears in the mobile menu for authenticated users
- Admin users are directed to `/dashboard/admin`
- Regular users are directed to `/dashboard`
- The button has a gradient background (`from-[#8B5CF6] to-[#10B981]`)

## User Role Routing
The Navbar implements role-based routing:
- **Admin Users**: `/dashboard/admin` (full admin dashboard)
- **Regular Users**: `/dashboard` (client dashboard)

## Code Implementation
The routing logic is implemented in `src/components/landing/Navbar.tsx`:

```typescript
<button 
  onClick={() => {
    if (session.user?.role === "admin") {
      router.push("/dashboard/admin");
    } else {
      router.push("/dashboard");
    }
    // Close mobile menu if open
    setIsMenuOpen(false);
  }}
  className="text-[#8B5CF6] hover:text-[#A78BFA] transition-all duration-300 text-sm font-medium nav-item-hover"
>
  Dashboard
</button>
```

## Design Consistency
The Navbar maintains design consistency with the redesigned admin dashboard:
- Uses the same color scheme (purple `#8B5CF6` and green `#10B981`)

The integration ensures seamless navigation to the admin dashboard while maintaining the professional, theme-oriented design.
