## Issues Fixed and Verified

### 1. Critical Environment Variable Issue
**Problem**: `RAZORPAY_SECRET` in [.env.development](file:///C:/Users/Chiranjeevi%20PK/Desktop/ev-bunker/.env.development) but code expected `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`
**Solution**: Renamed variable to `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED and VERIFIED

### 2. Parameter Name Mismatch
**Problem**: Client sending `orderId`, `paymentId`, `signature` but server expected Razorpay-specific names
**Solution**: Updated to `razorpay_order_id`, `razorpay_payment_id`, `razorpay_signature`
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED and VERIFIED

### 3. Client-Side Environment Variable
**Problem**: Using server-side `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID` instead of client-side `NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`
**Solution**: Updated to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`
**Status**: ‚úÖ FIXED and VERIFIED
