# End-to-End & Load Testing Strategy

This document outlines the approach to implement stress testing and verify system behavior for the EV Bunker application.

## Load Testing Utilities

The application includes custom load testing utilities that can be used to:

1. **Run Load Tests**: Test the application under a specific load with configurable concurrency
2. **Run Stress Tests**: Gradually increase load to identify breaking points
3. **Measure Performance**: Track response times, success rates, and error patterns

### Load Testing Components

- `runLoadTest()`: Execute a load test with specific parameters
- `runStressTest()`: Execute a series of load tests with increasing intensity

### Configuration Options

- **URL**: Target endpoint to test
- **Method**: HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- **Headers**: Custom headers for requests
- **Body**: Request body for POST/PUT requests
- **Concurrency**: Number of simultaneous requests
- **Requests**: Total number of requests to make
- **Timeout**: Request timeout in milliseconds

## End-to-End Testing

The application includes comprehensive end-to-end tests for core API endpoints:

1. **Health Check API**: Verifies the application is running
2. **Stations API**: Tests CRUD operations for charging stations
3. **Authentication API**: Tests user authentication flows
4. **Booking API**: Tests booking creation and management
5. **Payment API**: Tests payment processing workflows

## Testing Strategy

### Performance Testing

1. **Baseline Testing**: Establish performance baselines for all critical endpoints
2. **Load Testing**: Test under expected production loads
3. **Stress Testing**: Identify system breaking points
4. **Soak Testing**: Long-term testing to identify memory leaks and resource issues

### API Testing

1. **Functional Testing**: Verify all API endpoints work as expected
2. **Security Testing**: Test authentication, authorization, and input validation
3. **Error Handling**: Verify proper error responses for invalid requests
4. **Data Integrity**: Ensure data consistency across operations

### Real-time Testing

1. **WebSocket Connections**: Test real-time communication channels
2. **Redis Pub/Sub**: Verify message broadcasting works correctly
3. **Event Synchronization**: Ensure events are properly synchronized across clients

## Test Execution

### Running Load Tests

```bash
# Example load test command
npm run test:load -- --url=http://localhost:3000/api/stations --requests=1000 --concurrency=50
```

### Running End-to-End Tests

```bash
# Run all e2e tests
npm test __tests__/e2e/

# Run specific test suite
npm test __tests__/e2e/api.test.ts
```

## Monitoring During Tests

1. **Response Times**: Track average, minimum, and maximum response times
2. **Success Rates**: Monitor successful vs failed requests
3. **Error Patterns**: Identify common error types and their frequency
4. **Resource Usage**: Monitor CPU, memory, and network usage

## Test Results Analysis

### Key Metrics

- **Throughput**: Requests per second
- **Latency**: Response time percentiles (50th, 90th, 95th, 99th)
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of failed requests
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, and database usage

### Performance Benchmarks

- **Target Response Time**: < 200ms for 95% of requests
- **Target Error Rate**: < 0.1%
- **Target Availability**: 99.9%

## Stress Test Scenarios

### Gradual Load Increase

1. Start with baseline load (10 concurrent users)
2. Increase by 25% every 5 minutes
3. Monitor system behavior at each step
4. Identify breaking point where performance degrades

### Spike Testing

1. Simulate sudden traffic spikes
2. Test system recovery after spike
3. Verify auto-scaling mechanisms

### Long-term Stability

1. Run continuous load for 24+ hours
2. Monitor for memory leaks
3. Check database connection stability
4. Verify cache performance

## Test Environment

### Development Environment

- Local MongoDB instance
- Local Redis instance
- Local Next.js server

### Staging Environment

- Staging MongoDB cluster
- Staging Redis instance
- Staging Next.js deployment

### Production Environment

- Production MongoDB cluster
- Production Redis cluster
- Production Next.js deployment on Vercel

## Reporting

### Test Reports

1. **Performance Reports**: Detailed metrics and charts
2. **Error Reports**: Categorized error analysis
3. **Resource Reports**: System resource usage
4. **Comparison Reports**: Performance trends over time

### Alerting

1. **Performance Degradation**: Alerts when response times exceed thresholds
2. **Error Spikes**: Alerts when error rates exceed normal patterns
3. **Resource Exhaustion**: Alerts when system resources are critically low

## Continuous Integration

### Automated Testing

1. **Pre-deployment Tests**: Run before each deployment
2. **Post-deployment Tests**: Verify deployment success
3. **Scheduled Tests**: Regular performance testing

### Test Coverage

- **API Coverage**: 100% of critical endpoints
- **Load Coverage**: Test all expected load patterns
- **Security Coverage**: Test all security features

This testing strategy ensures the application can handle expected loads while maintaining performance and reliability standards.
