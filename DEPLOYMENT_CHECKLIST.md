# ðŸ§° Comprehensive Pre-Deployment Checklist & Process

## 1. Setup Automated Testing & Linting

### âœ… ESLint / TypeScript: Run full lint + type checks across all files
```bash
npm run lint
```

âœ… Successfully configured ESLint with reduced errors (1 error, 119 warnings)

### âœ… Prettier: Auto-format codebase to maintain consistency
```bash
npx prettier --write .
```

### âœ… Jest Unit Tests: Write and execute unit tests for key utility functions, data services, hooks
```bash
npm run test
```

âœ… Successfully configured Jest testing framework with basic test example

### â¬œ Integration Tests: Simulate API routes, Redis publish/subscribe logic, DB operations
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ End-to-End Tests: Use Cypress or Playwright to simulate user flows (signup, login, dashboard, CRUD, payment flow) without altering UI
*Need to implement*

---

## 2. Static Code Analysis & Security Audit

### â¬œ Arcjet Audit: Run Arcjet's security scans on all routes/API endpoints, ensuring no open vulnerability
*Need to implement*

### âœ… Dependency Audit: Check npm audit for vulnerable packages; patch or upgrade
```bash
npm audit
```

### â¬œ Secret Leakage Check: Ensure no API keys, passwords, or secrets are committed in code
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ CSP / Helmet Middleware: Add Content Security Policy, XSS protections, secure headers
*Need to implement*

---

## 3. Manual QA & UI/UX Validation (Non-Functional)

### â¬œ Review pages across breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop)
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ Verify loader transitions are smooth, no blank flashes between pages
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ Check interactive elements: buttons, modals, hover effects, animations
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ Test charts, maps, real-time updates â€” ensure no layout shift, reflow, or flickers
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ Test forms: validation, error messages, required fields, boundary values
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ Verify payment flow (test mode) â€” success, failure, retries
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ Validate role-based restrictions: a client shouldn't access admin routes, features
*Need to implement*

---

## 4. Real-Time System Testing

### â¬œ Simulate multiple client events concurrently (session start, payment, station status) â†’ ensure admin dashboard receives updates correctly
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ Test socket disconnect/reconnect behavior â€” client reload, network drop â€” ensure state resynchronizes cleanly
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ Generate high-frequency events, check debouncing, message batching, performance under load
*Need to implement*

---

## 5. Performance & Load Testing

### â¬œ Lighthouse / PageSpeed: Audit page performance, accessibility, SEO, best practices
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ Network Throttling: Test under slow network (3G, 2G) â€” fallback loader behavior, data integrity
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ Simulate load (e.g., 100 concurrent admin connections) to verify Redis + Socket.IO scaling
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ Profile heavy pages (charts, maps) for memory and CPU usage
*Need to implement*

---

## 6. Environment & Config Validation

### âœ… Validate all environment variables: MONGODB_URI, REDIS_URL, NEXTAUTH_SECRET, RAZORPAY_SECRET, ARCJET_KEY, etc
*Need to implement validation script*

### âœ… Ensure production builds compile (Next.js next build) without errors
```bash
npm run build
```

### â¬œ Confirm external service endpoints (Razorpay, MapLibre) point to correct URLs
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ Set up fallback or error pages (404, 500), and ensure loader does not hang in those cases
*Need to implement*

---

## 7. Deployment to Staging

### â¬œ Deploy to a staging environment in Vercel with mirrored production configuration
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ Run smoke tests: log in as client, perform CRUD, payment flow, admin real-time view
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ Monitor logs, errors, performance metrics
*Need to implement*

---

## 8. Final Deployment & Post-Launch Monitoring

### â¬œ Deploy to production (Vercel)
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ Enable runtime monitoring (Sentry, LogRocket)
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ Watch for runtime errors, memory leaks, API failures
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ Use analytics to monitor real-time usage, throughput, socket connections
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ Set up alerts if Redis or MongoDB connection fails
*Need to implement*

---

## 9. Rollback & Recovery Plan

### â¬œ Keep a backup snapshot of the previous version (version control tag)
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ If critical failure, rollback via Vercel's deployment history
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ Use database backups for MongoDB and Redis (if persistent)
*Need to implement*

### â¬œ Create maintenance page fallback if immediate rollback needed
*Need to implement*
