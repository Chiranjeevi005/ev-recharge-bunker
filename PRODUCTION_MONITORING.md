# Production Monitoring & Alerting

This document outlines the monitoring and alerting strategy for the EV Bunker application in production.

## Monitoring Architecture

### Components

1. **Application Metrics**
   - HTTP request rates and response times
   - Error rates and patterns
   - Database query performance
   - Redis cache performance
   - Custom business metrics

2. **Infrastructure Metrics**
   - CPU usage
   - Memory usage
   - Disk I/O
   - Network traffic
   - Container health

3. **External Services**
   - Database connectivity
   - Redis connectivity
   - Third-party API health
   - CDN performance

### Tools

- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection and storage
- **Grafana**: Visualization and dashboarding
- **Alertmanager**: Alert routing and notification
- **Custom Logging**: Application-specific logging

## Metrics Collection

### HTTP Metrics

- Request rate (requests per second)
- Response time percentiles (50th, 90th, 95th, 99th)
- Error rates by status code
- Request size distribution

### Database Metrics

- Connection pool usage
- Query response times
- Slow query detection
- Database uptime

### Redis Metrics

- Connection count
- Memory usage
- Hit/miss ratio
- Command performance

### Business Metrics

- User registrations
- Booking creation
- Payment processing
- Authentication attempts
- Real-time message delivery

## Alerting Strategy

### Alert Levels

1. **Critical**: Immediate attention required, potential service outage
2. **Warning**: Attention required, potential issue developing
3. **Info**: Informational, no immediate action required

### Alert Types

#### Application Alerts

- **High Error Rate**: >5% error rate for 5 minutes (warning), >10% for 1 minute (critical)
- **High Latency**: >500ms for 2 minutes (warning), >1s for 2 minutes (critical)
- **Payment Processing Failure**: Any payment failures detected (critical)
- **Authentication Failure Rate**: >10 failures per minute (warning)

#### Infrastructure Alerts

- **Database Down**: Database connectivity lost (critical)
- **Redis Down**: Redis connectivity lost (critical)
- **High Memory Usage**: >90% memory usage for 2 minutes (warning)
- **High CPU Usage**: >80% CPU usage for 2 minutes (warning)

#### Business Alerts

- **Booking System Issues**: Booking creation failures (critical)
- **Payment Gateway Issues**: Payment processing delays (warning)
- **User Registration Issues**: Registration failures (warning)

## Notification Channels

### Primary Channels

- **Slack**: Real-time notifications to dedicated channels
- **Email**: Detailed reports and summaries
- **SMS**: Critical alerts requiring immediate attention

### Escalation Policies

1. **Level 1**: DevOps team (15-minute response)
2. **Level 2**: Engineering team lead (30-minute response)
3. **Level 3**: CTO/Engineering VP (1-hour response)

## Dashboard Views

### Overview Dashboard

- Current system status
- Key performance indicators
- Active alerts
- Recent deployments

### Performance Dashboard

- HTTP request rates and response times
- Database performance
- Redis performance
- Resource utilization

### Business Dashboard

- User registrations and logins
- Booking metrics
- Payment processing
- Revenue metrics

## Health Checks

### API Health Endpoint

- `/api/health-check`: Comprehensive system health
- `/api/health`: Basic application health
- `/api/metrics`: Prometheus metrics endpoint

### Automated Health Monitoring

- Continuous health checks every 30 seconds
- Alert on consecutive failures
- Automatic recovery attempts

## Log Management

### Log Levels

- **Error**: Critical issues requiring immediate attention
- **Warn**: Potential issues that should be investigated
- **Info**: General information about application operation
- **Debug**: Detailed debugging information (production disabled)

### Log Retention

- Error logs: 90 days
- Info logs: 30 days
- Debug logs: 7 days

## Incident Response

### Incident Classification

- **Severity 1**: Service outage affecting users
- **Severity 2**: Degraded performance affecting users
- **Severity 3**: Issues with no user impact

### Response Procedures

1. **Acknowledge**: Confirm receipt of alert
2. **Investigate**: Determine root cause
3. **Mitigate**: Implement temporary fixes
4. **Resolve**: Apply permanent fix
5. **Document**: Record incident and lessons learned

### Post-Incident Review

- Root cause analysis
- Impact assessment
- Preventive measures
- Process improvements

## Monitoring Best Practices

### Proactive Monitoring

- Set appropriate thresholds
- Monitor trends, not just current values
- Use historical data for baselines
- Regular review of alert rules

### Alert Tuning

- Minimize false positives
- Ensure alerts are actionable
- Regular review of alert effectiveness
- Adjust thresholds based on business needs

### Performance Optimization

- Monitor resource usage trends
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Optimize database queries
- Cache frequently accessed data

## Security Monitoring

### Security Alerts

- Unauthorized access attempts
- Suspicious authentication patterns
- Data access anomalies
- Security policy violations

### Compliance Monitoring

- Audit log retention
- Data protection measures
- Access control verification
- Security policy adherence

This monitoring and alerting strategy ensures comprehensive visibility into the application's health and performance, enabling rapid detection and response to issues.
