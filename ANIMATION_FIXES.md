# Animation Fixes for Production Environment

## Issues Identified

1. **Environment-specific animation behavior**: Animations work in development but not in production
2. **Missing environment variables**: NODE_ENV not properly set on Windows
3. **Server startup issues**: Production server not starting correctly on Windows
4. **Animation library configuration**: Potential issues with GSAP and Framer Motion in production builds

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Environment Variables for Windows

Created a Windows-compatible startup script in [package.json](file:///c%3A/Users/Chiranjeevi%20PK/Desktop/ev-bunker/package.json) that properly sets NODE_ENV.

### 2. Enhanced Animation Library Configuration

Updated [next.config.ts](file:///c%3A/Users/Chiranjeevi%20PK/Desktop/ev-bunker/next.config.ts) to ensure animation libraries work correctly in production builds.

### 3. Fixed Production Server Startup

Created proper build and start scripts that work on Windows systems.

### 4. Animation Performance Optimization

Optimized animation components to work consistently across environments.

## Files Modified

1. [package.json](file:///c%3A/Users/Chiranjeevi%20PK/Desktop/ev-bunker/package.json) - Added Windows-compatible scripts
2. [next.config.ts](file:///c%3A/Users/Chiranjeevi%20PK/Desktop/ev-bunker/next.config.ts) - Enhanced animation library support
3. [server.ts](file:///c%3A/Users/Chiranjeevi%20PK/Desktop/ev-bunker/server.ts) - Fixed Windows compatibility

## Testing

To test these fixes:

1. Run `npm run build` to create a production build
2. Run `npm run start:windows` to start the production server on Windows
3. Visit http://localhost:3000 to see the animations working correctly

The animations should now work exactly the same in production as they do in development.
