# Staging Deployment & Canary Rollout Checklist

This checklist ensures a smooth and safe deployment process with rollback capabilities.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist

### Code Quality
- [ ] All unit tests passing
- [ ] All integration tests passing
- [ ] Code linting completed with no errors
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful
- [ ] No uncommitted changes

### Environment Preparation
- [ ] Staging environment variables configured
- [ ] Database migrations applied to staging
- [ ] Redis cache cleared
- [ ] CDN cache invalidated
- [ ] Third-party service keys verified

### Testing
- [ ] Health check endpoints functional
- [ ] API endpoints tested
- [ ] UI components rendering correctly
- [ ] Authentication flows working
- [ ] Payment processing tested
- [ ] Real-time features verified

## Deployment Process

### 1. Canary Deployment (10% traffic)
- [ ] Deploy to canary environment
- [ ] Verify deployment health
- [ ] Monitor error rates
- [ ] Check performance metrics
- [ ] Validate user flows

### 2. Gradual Rollout
- [ ] Increase traffic to 25%
- [ ] Monitor for 15 minutes
- [ ] Increase traffic to 50%
- [ ] Monitor for 30 minutes
- [ ] Increase traffic to 75%
- [ ] Monitor for 1 hour
- [ ] Increase traffic to 100%

### 3. Full Rollout
- [ ] Promote canary to production
- [ ] Update DNS records
- [ ] Verify SSL certificates
- [ ] Test all critical user flows
- [ ] Monitor application performance

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Health Checks
- [ ] Application health endpoint responsive
- [ ] Database connections stable
- [ ] Redis connections stable
- [ ] Third-party service integrations working
- [ ] Real-time features functional

### Performance Monitoring
- [ ] Response times within acceptable range
- [ ] Error rates below threshold
- [ ] Database query performance
- [ ] Memory usage stable
- [ ] CPU usage within limits

### User Experience
- [ ] Critical user flows working
- [ ] UI rendering correctly
- [ ] No broken links or assets
- [ ] Authentication working
- [ ] Payments processing

## Rollback Plan

### Trigger Conditions
- [ ] Error rate exceeds 5%
- [ ] Response time exceeds 2x baseline
- [ ] Critical functionality broken
- [ ] Data integrity issues detected
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities discovered

### Rollback Steps
1. [ ] Halt deployment
2. [ ] Identify root cause
3. [ ] Execute rollback script
4. [ ] Verify rollback success
5. [ ] Monitor post-rollback health
6. [ ] Communicate status to stakeholders

### Rollback Verification
- [ ] Previous version deployed
- [ ] Application health verified
- [ ] User flows tested
- [ ] Performance metrics restored
- [ ] Error rates normalized

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Real-time Monitoring
- [ ] Application performance dashboard
- [ ] Error tracking system
- [ ] Infrastructure monitoring
- [ ] User experience monitoring
- [ ] Business metrics tracking

### Alerting Thresholds
- [ ] Error rate > 1% (warning)
- [ ] Error rate > 5% (critical)
- [ ] Response time > 200ms (warning)
- [ ] Response time > 500ms (critical)
- [ ] Database errors (critical)
- [ ] Redis connectivity issues (critical)

## Communication Plan

### Stakeholders
- [ ] Development team
- [ ] Operations team
- [ ] Product team
- [ ] Customer support
- [ ] Executive team

### Notification Channels
- [ ] Slack channels
- [ ] Email alerts
- [ ] SMS alerts (critical)
- [ ] Status page updates
- [ ] Customer notifications (if needed)

## Post-Deployment Tasks

### Documentation
- [ ] Update deployment documentation
- [ ] Record deployment metrics
- [ ] Document any issues encountered
- [ ] Update runbooks if needed
- [ ] Share learnings with team

### Cleanup
- [ ] Remove temporary debugging code
- [ ] Clean up old deployment artifacts
- [ ] Update environment configurations
- [ ] Rotate any temporary credentials
- [ ] Archive deployment logs
