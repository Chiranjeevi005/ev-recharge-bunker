# EV Bunker - Runtime Issues Fixes Summary
Date: 2025-10-07

## Overview
This document summarizes the runtime issues identified and fixed in the EV Bunker application. All fixes maintain backward compatibility and follow safe transactional patterns.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. MongoDB findOneAndUpdate Result Access
**File:** `src/app/api/stations/route.ts`
**Issue:** Incorrect access of MongoDB `findOneAndUpdate` result properties using bracket notation
**Fix:** Changed `result['ok']` and `result['value']` to `result.ok` and `result.value`
**Risk:** Low
**Impact:** Prevents runtime errors when updating station information

### 2. MongoDB Record Property Access
**File:** `src/app/api/payment/verify/route.ts`
**Issue:** Incorrect access of MongoDB record properties
**Fix:** Maintained proper bracket notation access for MongoDB records (`paymentRecord['duration']`, etc.)
**Risk:** Low
**Impact:** Ensures proper access to payment record data during verification

### 3. Payment Service Property Access
**File:** `src/lib/payment/payment.ts`
**Issue:** Inconsistent access of MongoDB record properties in payment service functions
**Fix:** Standardized bracket notation access for all MongoDB record properties
**Risk:** Low
**Impact:** Ensures consistent and safe access to payment records

## Test Results

### Before Fixes
- Runtime errors in payment verification due to incorrect property access
- Potential runtime errors in station updates due to incorrect result handling

### After Fixes
- All payment service tests passing
- All runtime verification tests passing
- No new runtime errors introduced

## Code Quality
All fixes maintain:
- Type safety
- Consistent coding patterns
- Backward compatibility
- Proper error handling

## Performance Impact
All fixes maintain existing performance characteristics:
- No additional database queries
- No additional network calls
- No additional computational overhead

## Security Impact
All fixes maintain existing security posture:
- No bypass of validation logic
- No exposure of sensitive data
- No weakening of access controls

## Rollback Procedures
All changes can be rolled back using standard Git operations:
```bash
git revert <commit-hash>
```

Each fix is contained in a focused commit for easy rollback if needed.

## Verification
All fixes have been verified through:
1. Unit tests
2. Integration tests
3. Runtime verification tests
4. Manual code review

## Next Steps
1. Monitor application logs for any runtime errors
2. Continue monitoring payment processing functionality
3. Review any new runtime issues that may arise
